/**
 * @file __tests__/components/FileUpload.test.tsx
 * @description
 * This file contains an example unit test for the FileUpload component.
 * It renders the component and verifies that the upload UI (e.g., the heading text)
 * is rendered correctly.
 * 
 * Key features:
 * - Uses React Testing Library to render the component.
 * - Asserts that the component displays the expected text.
 * 
 * @dependencies
 * - React: For JSX and component rendering.
 * - @testing-library/react: To render and query the component.
 * - @testing-library/jest-dom: To use extended matchers like toBeInTheDocument().
 * - FileUpload component: The component under test.
 * 
 * @notes
 * - This is a basic test example. Additional tests should be written for edge cases,
 *   event handling, and integration with Supabase functions.
